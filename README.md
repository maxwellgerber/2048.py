# 2048.py

Tiny 2048 command line thing I started halfway through CS61A
Has support for:
	Filesaving (python pickling)
	Scaling the size of the game board (Up to 10x10)
	Working high score board

TODO:
	Figure out how to read arrowkeys without importing pyGame
	More colorful outputs?
	General dicking around. Learning VIM+git while I do this
